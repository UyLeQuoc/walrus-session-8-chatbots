/**
 * How a reply that is not the model's reaches each client.
 *
 * Slash commands, the size guard and the rate limit answer without calling the
 * model. They used to answer with JSON everywhere, which suits the CLI and is
 * silently invisible in the web chat: `useChat` reads the response as a UI
 * message stream, finds no events in a JSON body, and shows nothing — no reply,
 * no error. Every command typed on the web, `/help` included, went nowhere.
 *
 * So the web gets the same text as a one-message stream, and the CLI keeps its
 * JSON, which also carries the files `/export` hands back. No imports from the
 * environment or the database, so this is tested in CI.
