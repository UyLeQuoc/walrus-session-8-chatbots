/**
 * A ceiling the caller cannot choose for itself.
 *
 * `checkRate` throttles per person, and a person is whoever the request says it
 * is: `x-hippo-guest` is a UUID the browser generates, and any well-formed one
 * that has not been seen before creates a new person with a fresh budget. Two
 * invented ids were used to confirm it against production, each getting a
 * working session of its own.
 *
 * That matters because the model budget is a fixed one dollar, roughly 2,300
 * turns, and the URL is about to appear in an article and a public post. A loop
 * sending a new UUID each time would empty it in minutes and end the real-use
 * week without anything looking broken.
 *
 * So this counts requests per client address, which a caller cannot mint. It is
 * in memory on purpose: the service runs one replica, because Telegram long
 * polling must not run twice, so there is nothing to share state with. If that
 * ever changes this has to move into Postgres or it becomes per-replica.
