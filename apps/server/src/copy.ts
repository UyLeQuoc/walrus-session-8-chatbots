 * docs/issues/12. The paragraph about not being able to delete is the

export const PRIVACY = `What happens to what you tell me:

• I decide what is worth keeping and write it to Walrus, a public storage network. Each memory is encrypted. Anyone can download the encrypted bytes; only the account that owns them can read them.
• Storage is paid per period. A memory written today lasts about seven months, then the bytes expire.
• Your memory lives in a space named after a random id, not your name or your handle. That name is visible on Sui.
• Until you run /connect, that space sits inside my own Walrus Memory account. After /connect new memories go into an account your wallet owns, and /disconnect takes my access to it away on chain.
• If you join a team, everyone in it can recall what the team has been told. Your own memory is not shared: only /team remember puts something in the team, and leaving does not take it back out, because a memory on Walrus cannot be deleted.
• What you told me before connecting stays in my account. It cannot be moved there and it cannot be deleted, so I keep reading it alongside yours, and I can still read it after you revoke me. /memory forget makes it unrecallable.

What you can do:

• /memory off stops me remembering anything new. /memory on resumes.
• /memory shows everything I hold. /memory forget makes it all unrecallable.

One limit worth knowing: forgetting removes it from search so nothing can bring it back, but the encrypted bytes stay on Walrus until they expire. Nobody can delete them early, including me. If that is not a trade you want, /memory off before you tell me anything.`;

/**
 * `/start` is the only copy most people will read, so it says the one thing that
 * makes hippo different rather than listing commands. `/help` does the listing.
 *
 * It also has to disclose, in two sentences, that this writes to a public
 * network. Somebody should never learn that from an article afterwards, and
 * burying it in /help would be the same as not saying it.
