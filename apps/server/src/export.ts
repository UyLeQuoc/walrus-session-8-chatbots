/**
 * The memory export: everything hippo can honestly hand back, and a plain
 * statement of what it cannot.
 *
 * "Your memory is yours" needs a file the person keeps. What can go in it is
 * decided by what Walrus Memory allows, not by what would look good:
 *
 * - **Metadata, always.** Blob id, type, date, channel, namespace, account,
 *   storage expiry, and links to the public ciphertext. Enough to find every
 *   memory on Walrus without hippo.
 * - **Text, when recall returns it.** There is no read-by-blob-id and no bulk
 *   read; recall is the only way text comes back, a hundred at a time. So text
 *   is recovered by recalling on each type tag until every blob is found.
 * - **Verified text.** hippo recorded the sha256 of every line it wrote. A
 *   recovered line is marked verified only if it hashes to that value, so the
 *   file proves it holds exactly what was written, not whatever came back.
 * - **Never the ability to decrypt it yourself.** The relayer seals with a key
 *   server the SDK does not list, behind an aggregator that needs an API key
 *   (docs/issues/12). The file says so rather than implying otherwise.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the database or the environment, so it is tested in CI
 * without credentials. The export is built per request and never stored:
 * memory text does not go into Postgres, and that includes a cached file.
