/**
 * `bun run prune:people` — remove person rows that hold nothing.
 *
 * Every anonymous visitor creates a person, which is how guest mode works, but
 * a crawler, a preflight, or the SameSite cookie bug we hit in production all
 * leave a person behind with no memories and no conversation. Those rows make
 * `bun run evidence` overstate how many people have used hippo, and the submission
 * asks for that number.
 *
 * Deliberately conservative. A row is only removed when it has no memories, no
 * turns, no delegate key, no wallet identity, and is older than the cutoff, so
 * a visitor who is mid-first-message is never deleted out from under their own
 * cookie.
 *
 *   bun run prune:people              # dry run
 *   bun run prune:people --run        # delete
 *   bun run prune:people --run --older-than 2h
