/**
 * Register hippo's slash commands with Discord.
 *
 * Discord needs commands registered over REST before they appear; the gateway
 * connection alone does not publish them. Run once after setting
 * DISCORD_TOKEN and DISCORD_CLIENT_ID, and again whenever the list changes.
 *
 *   bun run --filter @hippo/server discord:commands            # global, up to an hour to propagate
 *   bun run --filter @hippo/server discord:commands <guildId>  # one server, instant, good for testing
 *
 * The handlers live in apps/server/src/chat/commands.ts and are shared with every
 * other channel, so this file only publishes the names.
