/**
 * `pnpm capacity` — will this survive the real-use week?
 *
 * Three things can end M6 quietly: the model key running out of credit, the
 * database filling its free tier, and the relayer refusing us. The first is the
 * likely one, because the OpenRouter key is capped rather than metered, so it
 * stops dead at a number rather than costing more.
 *
 * Every figure is read live. Nothing here is estimated except the runway, and
 * that is labelled as an upper bound with the reason.
