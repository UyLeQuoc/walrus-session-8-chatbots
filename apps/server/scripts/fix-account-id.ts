/**
 * One-off: repair `memory_index.account_id` rows that recorded the account we
 * thought we were writing to rather than the one the relayer actually used.
 *
 * Guest-mode writes are authenticated by the operator's delegate key, and the
 * relayer resolves the account from that key alone — it never reads the id we
 * send. So every guest memory went to the operator's account in the deployment
 * `GET /config` reports, while our env named the superseded deployment's
 * account for a week (docs/issues/11). The blobs are fine; only this column is
 * wrong, and leaving it wrong would make `pnpm evidence` report two accounts.
 *
 *   tsx scripts/fix-account-id.ts            # report only
 *   tsx scripts/fix-account-id.ts --apply    # write
