/**
 * Streaming text that arrives by the word, not by the character.
 *
 * The catch-up maths and the word-boundary cut are taken from React Bits Pro's
 * `ai-chat-3`, which is the one genuinely reusable thing in that block; the
 * rest of it is a mockup of somebody else's product. Two changes were needed to
 * wire it to real data.
 *
 * The original is fed deltas through a `push(chunk)` callback. The Vercel AI
 * SDK hands us the whole text so far on every render, so this takes the target
 * string directly and derives the rest.
 *
 * Why it is worth having at all: without it, a token boundary lands mid-word
 * and a reader watches "Vietnam" become "Vietnames" become "Vietnamese". The
 * buffer runs behind the stream and only ever reveals whole words, which reads
 * as typing rather than as a machine.
