/**
 * Something to click, for somebody who has thirty seconds.
 *
 * The first set is things to teach hippo. After a real answer it switches to
 * the half that matters: reload, then ask. The reload is the point, because a
 * page with no history cannot be answering from context.
 *
 * The old labels and the explanation under them made the empty chat read like
 * a manual, so they stay here as comments and are not rendered:
 * "Try one"
 * "Now prove it"
 * Reloading throws the conversation away. Anything hippo still knows came back from Walrus, not from the page.
