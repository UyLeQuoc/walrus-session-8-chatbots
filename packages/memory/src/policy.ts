 * memory is still the first thing in the block.
 *
 * It is needed because a contradiction is not a near-duplicate.
 * `rememberWithDedupe` collapses anything under `DISTANCE.duplicate`, but "I
 * switched to bun" sits in the related band against "I only use pnpm", so both
 * are stored and both are recalled — and measured on production, the stale one
 * ranked *higher* (docs/SCOPE-RESEARCH.md §1).
 *
 * The key is the relayer's `created_at`, the write time to the second. The date
 * inside our own text format is only a day, which cannot order a correction
 * made ten minutes after the fact it corrects. It is the fallback for relayers
 * old enough to omit `created_at`, and undated memories sort last: an undated
 * line predates the dated format, so it must never outrank a dated correction.
 *
 * Not `recall({ sort: "recent" })`. That reorders on the relayer and then
 * truncates, so it changes *which* memories come back, and would let a recent
 * vague line push out an older exact match.
