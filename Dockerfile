# hippo server: the Hono API plus the Telegram, Discord and Slack adapters in
# one long-running process. The web app is a separate static build.
#
# Deliberately not a multi-stage build with a compile step: the server runs
# TypeScript through tsx, so there is no artefact to copy out. Deliberately no
# typecheck or tests either; CI runs those on every push, and re-running them
# here only makes a deploy fail for reasons a deploy cannot fix.
